#### ES.next in a boxâ„¢

Zero-config REPL for experimenting with next-generation JavaScript.

It automatically compiles and re-runs your script every time you save. Think  of it as a JSBin-like setup for your local editor and terminal â€“ with full access to Node APIs and modules.

![demo-gif]

As well as for experimenting, ESBox may be useful in situations like workshops and screencasts â€“ it makes it easy to do live code demos in ES2016 and beyond, without getting bogged down in build systems.

## Install

```sh
> npm install -g esbox
```

## Usage

To run `script.js` in a box:

```sh
> esbox script.js
```

Every time you save the file, ESBox clears the terminal display and runs your script again. Any uncaught errors get pretty-printed for easy debugging.

For more options, see `esbox --help`.

## Automatic Babel compilation

You can use any proposed ECMAScript features that Babel supports ([stage-0](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-0/) and above), including async/await, destructuring, rest/spread, etc.

## Magic imports

You can `import` a number of popular npm packages without needing to install them first.

This includes lodash, bluebird, chalk, chai, express, request â€“ and anything else listed under `dependencies` in [ESBox's own package.json](./package.json).

This is made possible by rewiring `require()` to use ESBox's own node_modules folder as an extra possible module source. (Locally installed modules relative to your script still take precedence if found.)

For example, a script like this _just works_ in ESBox:

```js
import cheerio from 'cheerio';
import fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch';
import { cyan } from 'chalk';

(async () => {
  const result = await fetch('https://www.nytimes.com');
  console.assert(result.ok);

  const $ = cheerio.load(await result.text());

  console.log('The New York Times headlines:');

  $('.story-heading').each((i, element) => {
    console.log(' ', cyan($(element).text().trim()));
  });
})();
```

## Advanced: custom Babel config

By default, ESBox will use a Babel config that makes all stage-0+ features work. But ideally you could also bring your own config. Currently, Babel has a [bug](https://phabricator.babeljs.io/T7098) that means it won't respect `.babelrc` files. Until that's fixed, you can instruct ESBox to use a `.babelrc` file located next to your script, like this:

```sh
> esbox script.js --babelrc
```

Or you can specify a directory to look for a `.babelrc` file in, like this:

```sh
> esbox script.js --babelrc /path/to/dir
```

> This feature is a stopgap to work around a Babel issue. It might only affect your entry file. It will probably be removed in future and `.babelrc` files will just work.
